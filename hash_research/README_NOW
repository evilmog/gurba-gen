1) this users password is password
2) this game takes the users password and adds on their username to
   the end so if the password is password and the username is integgroll
   then the hash is SHA1("passwordinteggroll")
3) the file format is name "integgroll" + newline then password "
   hash" only instead of it being in ascii, its straight up raw
   so you need to hexdump

What I need is username:hash so in this case the expected output is
integgroll:ded514493822cddc3dc0c73307b3d655b166c42e

parse.py is my current attempt
