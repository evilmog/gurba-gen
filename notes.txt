from turn wheel:
With all your strength, you turn the wheel. There appears to be a sudden
shift in the low humming of the large boilers around you. A loud clanking
sound resounds in the pipes, only to die away in echos. There is a muffled
beeping noise, and one of the dots on a screen near the wheel fades away.
The dot was located in the northeast quadrant of the sewers.
