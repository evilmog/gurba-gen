Unlike the security droids, the cyclophant is a human which has been trained in hand-to-hand combat. Dressed in tight-fitting black uniform with intermittent attachments of red body armour, he is indeed an imposing sight. This guard constantly scans the room for wrongdoings, but you don't have anything to fear from him as long as you commit no crime." --level 4 --gender male

You notice that his large plastic-rimmed spectacles are way too large for his face. Not to mention his over-sized Mickey Mouse tie, his gigantic long-sleeved shirt and his bulky wristwatch. He's so timid-looking, you can't help but wonder how Buddy managed to become the receptionist here." --level 5 --gender male

Now, after the Bug Girls split up to each go their separate ways, this cute baby-faced blonde has gone solo on her quest to eradicate bugs entirely from the galaxy. She's here because Guniko hired her to settle some pest problems he's been facing in his REACTOR ONE area. Rumour is that her relationship with Guniko goes beyond the professional." --level 3 --gender female

It is pulsating weakly, the metallic skin changing tones and contours with each pulse. Within the metallic outer layer itself is a visible inner layer of some glowing stuff. Each pulse sends a ripple all over the cyberslime's tangible form. This is not just another ooze... this must be the amalgamation of the ooze and and the radiation generated by the reactor.
